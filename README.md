# 🧠 Thynkora-AI

**Thynkora-AI** is a decentralized, AI-powered mental wellness platform built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. It enables users to securely journal their emotions, receive supportive feedback from an empathetic AI, and contribute to the platform’s future through decentralized governance.

Designed with a strong emphasis on **privacy**, **cultural relevance**, and **scalability**, Thynkora-AI offers a mindful alternative to centralized mental health tools that often compromise user data and user agency.
